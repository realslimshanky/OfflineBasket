# OfflineBasket
Proposed idea for Google Scholarships Collaborative Project - Mobile Web Specialist track

### Description
Building a collaborative platform/dashboard like codepen.io on which folks can add their offline application with compatible browsers they've developed or tested it on. It'll be publicly available for other folks to simply download from the dashboard in order to run it. This can be a great place for folks to showcase their offline applications with the world. Idea list can also be added to attract new contributors if the application submitted by others is open source.
